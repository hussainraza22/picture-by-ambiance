 What sets Ambiance Studios apart from the other Dallas Wedding Photographers or  Dallas Engagement Photographers out there? 
<br>
<br>
<strong>•Our meticulous post-processing</strong>. We spend a tremendous amount of time reviewing, retouching, color correcting, and highlighting the beautiful details of each and every photograph. And we don't just process the photographs you agree to buy. We deliver all of the useable photographs from your day to you. <br>
<br>

<strong>•Two professional photographers at every event.</strong> We give you the skill, experience and talent of two primary photographers-one male, one female. While our styles differ, they completely compliment the other. This adds an interesting, unique and creative perspective to your wedding photography, and ultimately results in better quality photos and a more holistic approach to your wedding photographs and ultimately, your album. <br>
<br>
<strong>•You always get the Malyanis</strong> Many studios have figureheads that book your contract then farm out your event to a photographer you've never met, let alone confirm the quality of their work. When you meet with us, you meet your photographers/videographer. Along with their unique styles, perspectives, and personalities. <br>
<br>
<strong>•We are boutique</strong>-like and we do all the work ourselves. The consultations. The photography. The back-ups. The post-processing. The galleries. The albums. We love, love, love what we do, and we want to be sure our influence comes across in all parts, from start to finish. <br>
<br>
<strong>•We deliver our photos fast</strong>. Even for our most detailed, time-intensive wedding packages, we get your photos back to you in a maximum of 4 weeks. Typically in just 2-3 weeks. Quality never suffers. We just don't see our friends as much during wedding season. We're just as excited to see your photos as you are, and work tirelessly to reap the rewards. <br>
<h3>When You Hire Ambiance Studios for Your Wedding Event,</h3>
<br>
Photography, especially<em><strong> wedding photography, is a labor of love.</strong></em> Not only do you have to love what you do, you have to have a passion for people. This isn't something a wedding photographer can learn. You either have it, or you don't. <br>
